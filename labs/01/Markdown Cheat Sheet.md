## Markdown Cheat Sheet

### **Basic Formatations**

### **Headings:**

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). 
You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.

#Header one = 
# Header one
##Header two
## Header two

### **Italics:**

By using a (*) or (_) around your text makes it slanted to emphasize it.


-* This is italic * 
  
*This is italic*

_ This is also Italic _

_This is also Italic_

### **Bold:**

By using double asterisks ** or double underscore __ around your text makes the text thicker and darker to stand out.

** This text is bold **

**This text is bold**

__ This text is also bold __

__This text is also bold__
